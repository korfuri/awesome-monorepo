## Development Workflows

* [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com), a source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called â€˜trunkâ€™, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.
* [Branch By Abstraction](https://www.branchbyabstraction.com), is a set-piece technique to effect a â€˜longer to completeâ€™ change in the trunk.

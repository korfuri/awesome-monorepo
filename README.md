A curated list of awesome Monorepo tools, software and
architectures. Monorepos, short for mono-repositories, are
repositories that contain multiple projects, usually related to each
other.

* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) improves the handling of large files in Git.
* [GVFS](https://github.com/Microsoft/GVFS) virtualizes the file system beneath your git repo so that git and all tools see what appears to be a normal repo, but GVFS only downloads objects as they are needed. Windows only.
* [SlothFS](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitfs/+/HEAD/docs/manual.md) is similar to GVFS, but read-only. It works on Linux and macOS.
* [git subtree](https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree) merges and splits subtrees from your project into subprojects and back.
    * [git subsplit](https://github.com/dflydev/git-subsplit) automates and simplifies the process of managing one-way read-only subtree splits.
* [splitsh-lite](https://github.com/splitsh/lite) is a very fast git subtree alternative to splits subtrees from your project into subprojects.

#### Scaling info

* Atlassian's [Monorepos in Git](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/10/monorepos-in-git/) and [How to handle big repositories in Git](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/handle-big-repositories-git) cover scaling options for Git.

### Mercurial

#### Tools

* [hgwatchman](https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hgwatchman) and [Watchman](https://github.com/facebook/watchman), replaced by [fsmonitor](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/FsMonitorExtension) trigger partial, incremental builds when your files change

## Migration tools

* [Bazel's migration-tooling](https://github.com/bazelbuild/migration-tooling) repository.
* [Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go#generating-build-files) generates Bazel BUILD files automatically for Go packages.

* [Fastlane monorepo migration tools](https://github.com/fastlane/monorepo) tools for migrating code and github issues. Specific for fastlane so requires some code changes to use

## Development Workflows

* [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com), a source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.
* [Branch By Abstraction](https://www.branchbyabstraction.com), is a set-piece technique to effect a ‘longer to complete’ change in the trunk.
